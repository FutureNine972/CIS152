        <h3>Barrack Obama</h3>
        <blockquote>
            We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion.
            This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong.
            The world respects us not just for our arsenal;
            it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.

            A diagram of the organization of a website is called a site map.
            A site map represents the structure, or organization, of pages in a website in a visual manner.
            Creating the site map is one of the initial steps in developing a website.
